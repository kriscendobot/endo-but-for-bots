Narrow the `byteArray` pass style to plain frozen `Uint8Array` only; move
immutable byte-array utilities to `@endo/pass-style`; extract UTF-8 encoding
and decoding to new `@endo/utf8` package; add new `@endo/ascii` package for
ASCII encoding and decoding.

The `byteArray` pass-style brand check previously accepted both raw
immutable `ArrayBuffer` values and plain frozen `Uint8Array` values
backed by an immutable `ArrayBuffer`.
It now accepts only the latter shape: a plain frozen `Uint8Array` whose
backing buffer is a plain frozen immutable `ArrayBuffer`.
Raw immutable `ArrayBuffer` values are no longer recognised as
`byteArray`; the `ByteArray` TypeScript alias is now `Uint8Array` (was
`ArrayBuffer`).

`@endo/pass-style` gains three new subpath exports for working with
passable byte arrays:

- `@endo/pass-style/to-bytes.js` exports `frozenBytes(view)`: wraps a
  mutable `Uint8Array` in a hardened frozen `Uint8Array` backed by an
  immutable `ArrayBuffer`, producing a `byteArray`-passable value.
  (Replaces `@endo/bytes/to-immutable.js` and `bytesToImmutable`.)
- `@endo/pass-style/from-bytes.js` exports `thawnBytes(bytes)`: copies
  a passable byte array into a fresh mutable `Uint8Array` for use with
  APIs that reject immutable backing buffers.
  (Replaces `@endo/bytes/from-immutable.js` and `bytesFromImmutable`.)
- `@endo/pass-style/concat-bytes.js` exports `concatBytes(buffers)`:
  concatenates a list of passable byte arrays into a single new passable
  byte array.
  (Replaces `@endo/bytes/concat-immutables.js` and `concatImmutables`.)

`@endo/bytes` removes its three immutable-related modules
(`to-immutable.js`, `from-immutable.js`, `concat-immutables.js`) and
the corresponding exports from `package.json`.
`@endo/bytes` also removes `from-string.js` (`bytesFromText`) and
`to-string.js` (`bytesToText`); UTF-8 encoding and decoding moves to the
new `@endo/utf8` package.
`@endo/bytes` now concerns only mutable `Uint8Array` helpers:
`concat.js`, `equals.js`, and `compare.js`.
The `@endo/immutable-arraybuffer` dependency is also removed from
`@endo/bytes` as it was only required by `to-immutable.js`.
`@endo/bytes/compare.js` now also accepts optional start and end
indices for each argument, enabling subrange comparisons without
extra allocations.

`@endo/utf8` is a new package providing UTF-8 encoding and decoding via
the web `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` APIs, captured once at module
load for SES hardening.
It mirrors the shape of `@endo/hex` and `@endo/base64` with two focused
sub-path exports:
`encodeUtf8` (string to `Uint8Array`) and `decodeUtf8` (bytes to
string, lenient), with a third strict variant `strictDecodeUtf8` (bytes
to string, fatal on malformed sequences).

`@endo/ascii` is a new package providing ASCII encoding and decoding
using plain charCode arithmetic, without relying on `TextEncoder` or
`TextDecoder` (which do not support the `"ascii"` encoding label).
It provides two sub-path exports:
`encodeAscii` (string to `Uint8Array`, throws on values outside ASCII
range 0-127) and `decodeAscii` (bytes to string, passes non-ASCII bytes
through without error).

`@endo/pass-style` gains three additional sub-path exports for UTF-8
encoding and decoding that are aware of the byteArray passable form:
- `@endo/pass-style/encode-utf8.js` exports `encodeUtf8(s)`: encodes a
  string as a passable `byteArray` (frozen `Uint8Array` over immutable
  `ArrayBuffer`).
- `@endo/pass-style/decode-utf8.js` exports `decodeUtf8(input)`:
  decodes a byteArray passable or any `ArrayBufferView` to a string,
  substituting U+FFFD for malformed sequences.
- `@endo/pass-style/strict-decode-utf8.js` exports
  `strictDecodeUtf8(input)`: decodes a byteArray passable or any
  `ArrayBufferView` to a string, throwing on malformed sequences.

`@endo/marshal`: the byteArray rank-compare's `ArrayBuffer.prototype`
dispatch arm becomes dead code and is removed. Values arrive as a frozen
`Uint8Array` backed by an immutable `ArrayBuffer`. On the emulated
`@endo/immutable-arraybuffer` path such a wrapper has no integer-indexed
own properties, so the bytes are read by first copying each wrapper into
a genuine mutable `Uint8Array` (via `slice`, which the shim amplifies)
and then delegating the equal-length lexicographic comparison to
`@endo/bytes`'s `compareBytes`, deduplicating the byte-comparison loop.

`@endo/patterns`: the `byteArray` matcher's `TypeFromPattern` and
`getMatcherKind` types resolve to `Uint8Array` (was `ArrayBuffer`).

`@endo/ocapn`: updated all callers of the moved functions to import
from `@endo/pass-style` under the new names; replaced ASCII encoding
wrappers with direct calls to `@endo/ascii`; factored the
`compareUint8Arrays` subrange comparison into `@endo/bytes/compare.js`.

`@endo/bytes` now validates its `Uint8Array` arguments. `compareBytes`,
`bytesEqual`, and `concatBytes` read each byte through the
integer-indexed protocol, which a counterfeit that merely inherits from
`Uint8Array.prototype` (the emulated frozen byteArray wrapper) answers
with `undefined`. Previously such an argument completed successfully
with a wrong answer and no diagnostic; each function now rejects a
non-genuine integer-indexed `Uint8Array` argument up front with a
`TypeError`, enforcing the "passing a frozen byteArray throws" contract
the package README already stated.
