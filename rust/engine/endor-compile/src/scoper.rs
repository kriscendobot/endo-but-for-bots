//! The scoper — a transliteration of the AST pass in
//! `c/moddable/xs/sources/xsScope.c` at the oracle pin (design § roadmap
//! row 5; Design Decisions 4 and 5). It runs between the parser
//! ([`crate::parser`], stage-5 children 2–3) and the coder (a later
//! child), performing XS's two dispatch passes over the tree:
//!
//!   * **hoist** ([`fxParserHoist`]): builds the scope tree
//!     (global/eval/function/module/block/`with`/`catch` scopes), hoists
//!     `var` / function declarations, records lexical (`let` / `const` /
//!     `using`) declarations with their duplicate-declaration early
//!     errors, and poisons scopes reached by direct `eval` / `with`.
//!   * **bind** ([`fxParserBind`]): resolves every identifier access to
//!     its declaration up the scope chain, marks captured declarations as
//!     **closure** slots, and computes each function's `scopeCount` — the
//!     frame slot count the coder consumes.
//!
//! **Why this shape is normative.** The coder downstream assigns each
//! declaration its final frame index by walking a scope's declare list in
//! order (`node->index = coder->scopeLevel++`, `xsCode.c` `fxScopeCoded`);
//! bytecode embeds those indices, so the *order and count* of declare
//! nodes in each scope, the closure flags, and the per-function
//! `scopeCount` are a byte-identity contract. This module reproduces XS's
//! exact declare ordering, counter arithmetic, and closure marking; the
//! fixture tests ([`tests`]) pin them as the contract for the coder child.
//!
//! **Representation.** XS mutates the AST in place, hanging a `txScope*`
//! off each scope-creating node and an `access->declaration` off each
//! identifier. The endor AST ([`crate::ast`]) is an immutable value tree,
//! so instead this module keeps a scope **arena** ([`Scope`]) and keys the
//! per-node associations it needs (a node's scope, a node's hoist-time
//! extra flags) by the node's stable address. The observable result — the
//! scope tree, declare lists, counts, closure flags, `scopeCount`, and
//! access resolutions — is the same.
//!
//! Fold (named for the coder child, byte-identity is its bar): `using` /
//! `await using` are parser-folded at the pin already; class member →
//! init-function desugaring is likewise deferred to the coder, so class
//! scoping here covers the binding/heritage/`this` structure but not the
//! synthesized `constructorInit` / `instanceInit` bodies.
