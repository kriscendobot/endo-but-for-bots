//! The coder — a transliteration of `c/moddable/xs/sources/xsCode.c` at
//! the oracle pin (design § roadmap row 5; Design Decisions 4 and 5).
//! It is the last stratum of the stage-5 pipeline (lexer → parser →
//! scoper → **coder**) and the first that produces the byte-identity
//! evidence the stage bar is measured against: `compile(src)` must equal
//! `endor_oracle::run(src).bytecode` byte for byte.
//!
//! **Scope of this child (5/7).** The emitter *framework* is ported in
//! full and faithfully: the code-record list ([`Code`]), the `fxCoderAdd*`
//! constructors, targets/fixups, stack-depth accounting, and — the part
//! that visibly shapes the bytes — XS's exact **three-pass** serializer
//! (`fxParserCode`): pass 1 sizes every record with branches assumed
//! widest and accrues the `delta` slack; pass 2 chooses each branch's
//! `_1`/`_2`/`_4` width from the now-known target offsets, narrowing
//! `size`; pass 3 emits the bytes with the chosen widths and the
//! back-patched branch displacements. That is ported as the algorithm,
//! not an equivalent.
//!
//! The *node* surface ported here is the expression + simple-statement
//! half of `xsCode.c`: literals of every scalar kind, every
//! unary/binary/relational/logical/coalescing operator, the conditional,
//! sequence, expression statements, `if`/`else`, and blocks — the
//! constructs whose emission needs neither the scoper's per-access slot
//! resolution nor a nested function body. Identifier/property
//! loads-and-stores, `var`/lexical declarations, calls, `new`, member
//! access, object/array/template construction, and destructuring are the
//! back half, deferred to child 6; the honest fold is named in the
//! crate README and the completion report.
//!
//! **Child 6, first slice: symbol-free control flow.** The loop forms
//! (`while` / `do` / C-style `for`), labeled statements with break /
//! continue resolution (XS's `firstBreakTarget` / `firstContinueTarget`
//! label-target stacks and the environment/scope adjustments), `switch`,
//! `throw`, `debugger`, and `try` / `catch` / `finally` (including the
//! alias / finalize / jump target machinery that threads break / continue
//! / return out through a `finally` via the selector local) are ported
//! here. What each of these needs and *doesn't* yet have is a symbol
//! (atom) table: a declaring loop / block / `switch` scope, a `catch(e)`
//! binding, `for-in` / `for-of` / `for-await-of` (they emit `GET_PROPERTY
//! next` etc.), and `with` all reach a `NEW_LOCAL` / `SYMBOL` op keyed on
//! a source name, so they assert loudly and are deferred to the
//! atom-table slice. `for(let …)` / declaring cases are the same fold.
