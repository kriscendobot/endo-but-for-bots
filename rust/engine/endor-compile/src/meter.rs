//! The parse meter — endor's own deterministic, release-versioned cost
//! table for compilation, threaded through the lexer from the first
//! token (design § Metering; the accuracy-over-parity doctrine,
//! maintainer-directed 2026-07-04).
//!
//! DOCTRINE: the meter is endor's own frozen cost table, not a back-fit
//! of XS's `XS_PARSE_CODE_METERING`. The oracle certifies RESULTS (and
//! in stage 5, BYTES); computron-vs-oracle telemetry stays advisory. So
//! the constants below are endor's to freeze per release
//! (`endor-meter-N`); XS's `1 << 16`-per-parse-unit weight is recorded
//! only as the historical reference that motivated a per-unit shape.
//!
//! Threading the hook now — one counter bump per scanned token — is
//! cheap; retrofitting a meter into a finished lexer/parser is not. The
//! calibrated weights arrive with the frozen release table; until then
//! the shape (a monotone per-unit counter in 16.16 fixed point, read as
//! whole computrons via `>> 16`) is what matters and is what later
//! stages build on.
