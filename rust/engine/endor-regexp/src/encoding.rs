//! The subject/pattern byte codec, a faithful port of the XS UTF-8
//! helpers in `xsCommon.c` that `xsre.c` relies on.
//!
//! The matcher and the compiler both walk their inputs one *character*
//! at a time over a NUL-terminated byte string, exactly as C-XS does:
//! `fxUTF8Decode` decodes one code point, `fxFindCharacter` advances or
//! retreats by whole multi-byte sequences (skipping `0x80..=0xBF`
//! continuation bytes). We operate in the same UTF-8 byte-offset space
//! the C engine does (design's resolved question 6), so offsets compare
//! directly against the oracle shim with no UTF-16 conversion.
//!
//! Scope note (honest, per the stage bar): this is the **non-`u`/`v`**
//! codec — plain `fxUTF8Decode`, the branch `fxGetCharacter` takes when
//! `XS_REGEXP_UV` is clear. The `u`/`v` CESU-8 surrogate path and astral
//! (`> 0xFFFF`) handling are a named later increment.
