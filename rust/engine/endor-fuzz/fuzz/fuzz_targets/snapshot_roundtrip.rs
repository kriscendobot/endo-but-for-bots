//! Fuzz target (stage-6 child 4, design § Snapshots / Fuzzability): snapshot
//! round-trip invariance. Fuzzer bytes fold into an adversarially-shaped
//! machine image (a slot/chunk arena graph — closures, instances, bigints,
//! references, a free list, a value stack, and the symbol/key/name tables);
//! the image serialized with `write_machine`, read back with `read_machine`,
//! and re-serialized must be byte-identical, and the decoded image must equal
//! the original. Any divergence is a finding (the daemon's restore path relies
//! on this identity).
