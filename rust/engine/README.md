# Endor engine (rust/engine)

The oracle-locked transliteration of XS to Rust described in
[`designs/xs2rust-endor-engine.md`](../../designs/xs2rust-endor-engine.md).
An independent Cargo workspace (excluded from the repo-root workspace)
so it builds in-repo from the first commit (resolved question 9).

## Crates

| Crate | `unsafe` | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `endor-vm` | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` | Index-arena value/heap model, `Vec`-backed slot stack, `match`-dispatch interpreter over the stage-1 opcode subset, and the 16.16 fixed-point meter. |
| `endor-oracle` | audited FFI (the one exception) | Compiles JS to XS bytecode and runs it on C-XS, returning `(bytecode, result, run-only computrons)`. Dev/CI only; never linked into a shipped engine. |
| `endor-262` | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` | Dual-run harness: runs the same bytecode on `endor-vm` and the oracle, recording four-valued + computron agreement. |
| `endor-fuzz` | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` | cargo-fuzz targets 1 (differential source) and 2 (bytecode decoder), authored so the logic is a plain testable lib. |

## Building the oracle: the `c/moddable` pin

`endor-oracle` compiles the C-XS engine from the `c/moddable`
submodule. The design's Ground Truth names the pin
**`48ee02d8cfe0`** ("the pin lineage of the `c/moddable` submodule that
`rust/endo/xsnap/build.rs` compiles today"). Populate it with:

```sh
git -C c/moddable fetch --depth 1 --filter=blob:none \
    origin 48ee02d8cfe0dccb51ee2465cf6716b3468684a4
git -C c/moddable checkout 48ee02d8cfe0dccb51ee2465cf6716b3468684a4
```

The shallow sha-fetch above only works while the pin is an advertised
tip; GitHub now rejects it (`upload-pack: not our ref` — the `public`
branch has moved past the pin). Two working fallbacks (verified
2026-07-02):

```sh
# (a) full (non-shallow) fetch of public; the pin is an ancestor of it
git -C c/moddable fetch https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable public
git -C c/moddable checkout 48ee02d8cfe0dccb51ee2465cf6716b3468684a4

# (b) fetch from any sibling checkout that already holds the pin
git -C c/moddable fetch /path/to/sibling/c/moddable 48ee02d8cfe0dccb51ee2465cf6716b3468684a4
git -C c/moddable checkout 48ee02d8cfe0dccb51ee2465cf6716b3468684a4
```

Caution: `c/moddable` in a fresh checkout is an **empty gitlink
directory with no `.git`**, so a `git -C c/moddable ...` there walks up
and operates on the *superproject*. `git clone` a moddable repo into
`c/moddable` (or `git init` it) before running any of the fetches
above.

Two frictions the supervisor should note (they do not affect the
stage-1 result, which is bit-exact against this pin, but they affect
reproducibility and the "path dependency on xsnap" phrasing):

1. The submodule **gitlink** recorded in the superproject is
   `5516726818906190d3a042d8be90219ce9d51b45`, which is **not fetchable
   from upstream** (`upload-pack: not our ref`). The design's stated
   pin `48ee02d8cfe0` *is* the current `public` HEAD and is what the
   oracle builds against. Correcting the gitlink is a submodule bump
   this stage deliberately does **not** make on its own.
2. There is an **API drift** between the two shas: at `48ee02d8cfe0`,
   `fxInitializeSharedCluster` takes a `txMachine*` argument (the
   oracle shim passes `C_NULL`, as `xst262.c` does), whereas the
   existing `xsnap` crate's `ffi.rs` declares it argument-free. Because
   of this drift, and because `xsnap`'s `lib.rs` `include_str!`s
   generated SES bundles that are gitignored and absent from a fresh
   checkout, `endor-oracle` links the C-XS sources **directly** (reusing
   xsnap's audited `xsnap-platform.{c,h}` and the identical feature
   defines) rather than as a Cargo path dependency on `xsnap`.

## Running the harness

```sh
cd rust/engine
cargo run -p endor-262 --bin harness          # stage-1 corpus
cargo run -p endor-262 --bin harness -- '1 + 2 * 3'   # ad-hoc program
cargo test  --workspace -- --test-threads=1   # includes the bar as a test

# The real test262 language/ dual-run runner (stage-2 acceptance bar).
# Run per subtree — the C-XS oracle accumulates memory across a whole-tree
# walk, so `expressions`/`statements` in separate processes bound the RSS.
cargo run -p endor-262 --bin test262-language -- expressions
cargo run -p endor-262 --bin test262-language -- statements/for
# The stage-3 built-ins sections run through the same binary:
cargo run -p endor-262 --bin test262-language -- built-ins/Boolean
```

The stage-scoped curated corpora under `endor-262/corpora/` are the
bootstrap (stage-1 arithmetic/logic/control-flow; stage-2 var/loop/object;
stage-2b functions/closures/exceptions; stage-3 language string values +
numeric/chaining opcodes, and fundamentals — the intrinsic constructors as
first-class values, `Boolean`/`Object` native calls, the value globals
`undefined`/`NaN`/`Infinity`, and `new` constructor calls; stage-3 arrays —
the Array exotic object: literals with holes, computed index get/set over the
item chunk, the `length` accessor get/set, the dense `Array.prototype` methods
`push`/`pop`/`shift`/`unshift`/`indexOf`/`lastIndexOf`/`includes`/`fill`/
`slice`/`join`/`at`/`reverse`, the `Array(...)` constructor + `Array.isArray`,
the `values`/`keys`/`entries` array iterators, and the iteration protocol —
`for-of`, `for-in`, and array spread `[...arr]`), all bit-exact
(result AND computron) against the oracle. The stage-3 built-ins reach
endor's intrinsics by name: the oracle's `symbols` atom (decoded by
`endor-vm::symbols`) carries the C-XS compiler's program-local id→name
table, so a `Boolean`/`Object`/… reference relinks to endor's intrinsic
under the id that program assigned it (`endor_vm::run_program_with_symbols`). Per the maintainer directive on PR #600
(2026-07-03), the whole-section parity runs that succeed them draw from the
monorepo's existing `packages/test262-runner` test262 subset — the same
tree and convention that package already uses to prove XS↔Node HardenedJS
parity — rather than a separate pinned test262 submodule. The
`test262-language` runner (module `endor_262::test262`) assembles each
`language/` test the standard test262 way and dual-runs it, reporting an
**honest covered/skipped split**: `covered` is bit-exact (result AND
computron, four-valued completion) only; every skip is named by the opcode
or built-in gap that stopped endor (never folded into a pass rate); a wrong
primitive value is a hard divergence. The covered grammar is expressions,
`var`/scope/loops, objects, functions, closures, and exceptions — it does
not include the built-ins (`eval`/`String`/`Array`/`typeof`/real `Error`
objects) the bulk of `language/` needs, so most tests are honestly skipped
today, the covered count growing as later stages land the built-ins. See
the design's § test262 conformance (requirement 6).
