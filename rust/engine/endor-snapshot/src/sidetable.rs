//! The **side-table completeness ledger** — the bug class this crate is
//! designed against (job spec item 3; the review ledger's standing
//! snapshot note).
//!
//! In endor the heap is index arenas, but a machine's reachable state is
//! *not* wholly in those arenas: dozens of side tables ([`endor_vm`]'s
//! `Interp` fields) hold per-instance and per-activation state keyed by
//! slot index — function closures, the caught-exception jump chain, a
//! suspended generator's saved frame, a promise's pending reactions, the
//! harden worklist. **An atom grammar that serializes the arenas but
//! misses one of these is the snapshot-shaped version of a missing GC
//! root: it round-trips fine on trivial heaps and corrupts on real ones.**
//!
//! So the set of side tables is made *explicit and exhaustive here*, one
//! [`SideTable`] variant per table, enumerated against `Interp`'s actual
//! fields. [`SideTable::descriptor`] is an exhaustive `match`: the
//! compiler forces a new variant to be described the moment it is added,
//! and [`SideTable::ALL`] (guarded by [`tests::all_is_exhaustive`]) forces
//! it into the coverage ledger. Each descriptor records its
//! [`Coverage`] — whether the writer/reader in [`crate::image`] carries it
//! yet — so the remaining work is a compile-checked list, never a silent
//! omission.
//!
//! # Excluded transients — why "enumerated against `Interp`'s actual
//! fields" does not mean *every* field
//!
//! An `Interp` field is a side table this ledger must track only if it
//! carries *reachable machine state at a quiescent suspend point* (a crank
//! boundary — no frame is mid-execution). Two field classes are deliberately
//! **not** ledger rows because at that point they hold nothing, or nothing
//! that is not re-derived; excluding them is what keeps the list to genuine
//! snapshot obligations, and this is the audit trail for each:
//!
//! **Per-activation registers — empty at a crank boundary.** These describe
//! *the frame currently executing*; between cranks the call stack is
//! unwound, so each is at its inert default and carries no cross-crank state:
//! - `args`, `this_val`, `cur_func`, `cur_target` — the active call's
//!   arguments / receiver / callee / new-target; none while no call is live.
//! - `exception` — the in-flight thrown value; none outside a `throw`/catch
//!   window, all of which close before a crank returns.
//! - `locals`, `frame_slots`, `id_map` — the executing frame's local slots,
//!   saved-frame region, and name→local index map; all belong to a live
//!   activation and are re-established by the next crank's `BEGIN_*` prologue.
//! - `resume_status` — the generator/async resume signal, meaningful only
//!   mid-`resume`; a *suspended* generator's state is the `generators` row
//!   (tracked, Pending), not this register.
//!
//! **Boot-derived / program-symbol caches — re-derived, never stored.** These
//! are pure functions of the boot procedure and the program's `symbol_names`,
//! so restore reconstructs them rather than carrying an atom:
//! - `intrinsics`, `*_proto` (`object_proto`/`function_proto`/`array_proto`/
//!   `generator_proto`/…), `proto_methods`, `proto_data`, `well_known_symbols`,
//!   `default_keys`, `math_object`, `static_str` — boot artifacts at
//!   *deterministic* slot indices. `restore_snapshot_state` reconstructs the
//!   machine on a fresh [`endor_vm::Interp::new`] whose boot lands them at the
//!   same indices the snapshot arena's boot region uses, so they need no atom.
//! - `symbol_ids`, `next_intern_id`, and the name-keyed lookup-id caches
//!   (`length_id`/`name_id`/`value_id`/`done_id`/`size_id`/`byte_length_id`/
//!   `byte_offset_id`/`buffer_id`/`then_id`/`last_index_id`, plus the
//!   `regexp_getter_ids`/`regexp_result_ids` clusters) — **derived from
//!   `symbol_names`**, which *is* serialized. `restore_snapshot_state`
//!   re-derives all of them (`bind_program_symbols`) from the restored names,
//!   identically to boot; this is exactly what makes the `SymbolTables` row
//!   [`Coverage::RebuiltAtRestore`] rather than a silent omission. (The
//!   forward `symbol_names` itself is the ledger row, not a transient.)
