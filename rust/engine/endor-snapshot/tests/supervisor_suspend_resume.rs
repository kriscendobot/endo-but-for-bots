//! **Supervisor suspend/resume integration (stage-6 child 5, roadmap row 6).**
//!
//! Roadmap row 6's acceptance bar is *"supervisor suspend/resume integration
//! test passes on `-e endor-rs`"*: the endo daemon's worker supervisor
//! suspending an endor-engined worker to a snapshot and resuming it, through
//! the same lifecycle the C xsnap worker uses today.
//!
//! ## What this test actually exercises (and the honest boundary)
//!
//! The **real** daemon supervisor lives in the excluded `rust/endo`
//! workspace (`rust/endo/src/supervisor.rs`, the `Supervisor` /
//! `SuspendedWorker` types) and is bound to the C-XS `xsnap` crate; it
//! cannot yet depend on `endor-snapshot` (see the module-level GAP REPORT
//! in this file's companion tada report — separate workspace, no
//! `endor-rs` engine variant, an unbuildable worker/SES boot path, and the
//! post-stage-4 intrinsics the daemon boot needs). Wiring the *literal*
//! daemon `Supervisor` onto the endor engine is therefore the enumerated
//! remaining work, not something one invocation can land green.
//!
//! What IS reachable — and what this integration test pins — is the endor
//! snapshot surface (children 2–3) driven through the **exact lifecycle the
//! daemon supervisor drives**, reconstructed here as a faithful harness:
//!
//! - `rust/endo/src/supervisor.rs::mark_suspended` snapshots the worker to
//!   the CAS, **drops the live XS machine**, and retains only
//!   `SuspendedWorker { sha256, cas_dir, info, meter }` — the content hash,
//!   the store path, and the meter state, *not* the machine.
//! - On the next inbound message, `take_suspended` + `resume_from_cas`
//!   rebuild the machine from the CAS blob and `restore_meter` reinstates
//!   the held meter, after which the worker continues its next crank.
//!
//! The [`SupervisorHarness`] below is that state machine over the endor
//! `Interp`: handle-keyed live workers, a `suspended` map holding a
//! [`SuspendedRecord`] whose fields mirror `SuspendedWorker`, a `suspend`
//! that genuinely drops the machine and keeps only the CAS key + meter, and
//! a `resume` that restores from the store and asserts the meter travelled
//! through the *record* (mirroring `restore_meter`) rather than through a
//! machine kept alive across the gap. This is a supervisor-shaped
//! **integration** test, not a verb round-trip: the machine does not exist
//! between suspend and resume, exactly as in the daemon.
//!
//! The row-6 property proven: a worker suspended to the CAS at a crank
//! boundary and resumed on the next message continues in **both result and
//! final computron count** identically to a worker that never suspended.
