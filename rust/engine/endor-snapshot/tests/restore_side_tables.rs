//! Restore-time side-table rebuild regressions (supervisor stage-6 review,
//! PR #600). The side-table completeness ledger
//! (`endor_snapshot::sidetable`) once claimed `GlobalProps` and
//! `SymbolTables` were covered by the arena / serialized atoms, but
//! `Interp::restore_snapshot_state` reinstates arenas + stack + `symbol_names`
//! + meter only — the `global_props` id→slot index and the `symbol_ids`
//! inverse map + `next_intern_id` counter (all derived, HashMap-resident, not
//! arena state) stayed at their empty fresh-boot values. A runtime global
//! materialized in an earlier crank then vanished after suspend/resume.
//!
//! These tests lock the fix in the shape the review used: a real guest crank
//! materializes a runtime global, the machine is suspended via
//! `write_snapshot` and resumed via `from_snapshot_bytes` (the machine truly
//! reconstructed from bytes), and a second crank on the restored machine must
//! behave **identically to a machine that never suspended** — in both the
//! completion value and the final computron count.
//!
//! The programs are compiled from source through the pure-Rust
//! `endor-compile` pipeline (no oracle needed), which emits both the bytecode
//! and the `SYMB` atom, exactly as `dual_run` links a program.
