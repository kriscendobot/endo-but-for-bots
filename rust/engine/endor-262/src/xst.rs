//! `endor-xst`: the xst-analogue test262 runner for the Rust engine
//! (design [`designs/xs2rust-endor-test262-convergence.md`] § Part 2,
//! "Harness → `endor-xst`"). It plays for endor exactly the role
//! `xs/tools/xst.c` + `xst262.c` (@ `48ee02d8cfe0`) play for C-XS, plus the
//! one thing `xst` never had: a differential oracle.
//!
//! This module is the runner core (rollout step 1): full YAML frontmatter
//! ([`crate::frontmatter`]), the endor not-yet-implemented feature skip list
//! + `--features-include`, sloppy+strict double-run mode selection (strict a
//! named skip until the stage-5 compiler), negative verdicts (constructor
//! name vs `negative.type`, stack/memory aborts accepted for an expected
//! `RangeError`), the dual-run oracle wiring (verdict + observable agreement
//! gating, computron advisory, `--gate-meter-exact`, `--repeat N`
//! determinism), and the xst-shaped YAML report (`mode:` / `skip:` /
//! `fail:` plus the endor `advisory:` and `skip-detail:` extensions).
//!
//! It subsumes the dual-run harness rather than sitting beside it: the same
//! `assemble()` order (`sta.js`, `assert.js`, includes, body) and the same
//! [`crate::dual_run`] differential, with the verdict layer grown on top.
//! Pre-stage-5 the oracle is still the compiler (both engines run the
//! C-XS-emitted bytecode), so a divergence has one suspect; when
//! `endor-compile` lands the differential moves to source level and the
//! parse-phase negatives activate.
