//! The fuzz-trophies regression gate (design
//! [`designs/xs2rust-endor-test262-convergence.md`] § Part 1, "The fuzz-grammar
//! arms").
//!
//! `cases/regressions/` is the durable, portable home for differential-fuzz
//! trophies: each minimized, fixed source divergence is checked in as a
//! test262-style case (features `endor-dual-run`, the fuzz arm named in
//! `info:`), so a finding becomes a regression test rather than a line in a
//! stage corpus. This test runs that tree through the same `endor-xst`
//! machinery a nightly run uses and holds it to the one bar a regression case
//! must always meet: **zero divergence**. A case may still be a *named* skip
//! (a parse-phase negative waits on the `endor-compile` default flip, exactly
//! as the converted corpus does — see `cases/regressions/README.md`), but it
//! must never fail the runner's verdict/observable agreement. The moment a
//! future fix regresses, its checked-in trophy fails here.
//!
//! This is intentionally separate from `corpus_conversion_equivalence`: that
//! test proves the corpus → `cases/` conversion preserved coverage (and so
//! asserts every corpus case is *covered* end-to-end); regressions are not
//! corpus and legitimately carry parse-negative named skips, so they are held
//! only to the no-divergence bar here and are excluded there.
