//! Coverage-equivalence proof for the corpus → test262 conversion (design
//! [`designs/xs2rust-endor-test262-convergence.md`] § Part 1, "Conversion
//! mechanics and corpus retirement").
//!
//! This is the proof the retirement is gated on: the generated `cases/` tree
//! reproduces the coverage the retired `stage*_corpus()` bit-exact tests
//! carried — **same totals** (one case per corpus line, 1:1), **zero
//! divergence** (every case the covered grammar reaches meets the runner's
//! bar), and the **same bit-exact set under `--gate-meter-exact`** (every
//! meter-exact-tagged case reproduces its historical computron agreement, so
//! the gate is green). It runs the checked-in `cases/` tree through the same
//! `endor-xst` machinery a nightly run uses.
//!
//! The oracle accumulates process RSS across machine create/destroy cycles;
//! the case set is ~1.7k, well under the tens-of-thousands the whole-tree
//! `endor-xst` binary bounds with per-subtree subprocesses, so one in-test
//! pass is safe.
