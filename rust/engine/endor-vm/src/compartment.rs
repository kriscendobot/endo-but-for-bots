//! The native `Compartment` over shared frozen intrinsics (design §
//! Hardened JavaScript and Compartment; requirement 5).
//!
//! XS implements SES natively (`xsModule.c`'s compartment half):
//! intrinsics are created **once per machine** and referenced per realm,
//! every evaluator is reachable for per-compartment replacement, and a
//! compartment is a fresh `globalThis` over those shared intrinsics with
//! its own module map. Stage 1 carved exactly those seams (shared
//! intrinsics behind an `Rc`, fresh per-compartment globals, an
//! `evaluate` that runs bytecode against them); this child grows the seam
//! into the full native shape the SES suites probe:
//!
//! - **Per-compartment globals** over shared intrinsics, with endowments
//!   copied onto the new global at construction and a `globalThis` whose
//!   identity is the compartment's own (distinct per compartment, stable
//!   for one compartment) — [`Compartment::global_this`].
//! - **Per-compartment evaluators**: [`Compartment::evaluate_with_symbols`]
//!   links the program's intrinsic references to the shared intrinsics
//!   (by the C-XS symbol atom) and seeds **this** compartment's globals,
//!   so two compartments over one machine's intrinsics diverge exactly
//!   and only in their own globals.
//! - **Nested compartments**: [`Compartment::new_compartment`] mints a
//!   child over the **same** machine intrinsics with fresh globals and a
//!   fresh globalThis identity — a Compartment created inside a
//!   compartment chains correctly.
//! - **Module map integration**: a compartment owns a
//!   [`crate::module::ModuleGraph`] (the `new Compartment({ modules,
//!   resolveHook, importHook })` surface). Static imports resolve through
//!   the compartment's module map ([`Compartment::import_static`]);
//!   dynamic `import()` is an honest **named skip**
//!   (`compartment:dynamic-import`), the async host loader the static
//!   half does not build.
//!
//! **Scope fold (recorded honestly).** endor models `Compartment` as a
//! host-side Rust realm API — matching XS's C-level compartment
//! machinery in `xsModule.c` — **not** as a guest-callable `Compartment`
//! intrinsic. A guest program's `new Compartment().evaluate('…')` would
//! require endor's interpreter to expose a native `Compartment`
//! constructor whose `evaluate` re-enters the compiler; that re-entrant
//! compile seam needs the oracle at run time, which `endor-vm`
//! deliberately does not link (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, no FFI). So a
//! program that *references the `Compartment` intrinsic itself* is a
//! named skip (`compartment:intrinsic-surface`) in the differential
//! harness, exactly as the module goal is a named skip on the oracle
//! seam. The differential this child DOES certify is evaluator
//! faithfulness + shared-intrinsics identity (see `endor-262`'s
//! `compartment` dual-run) plus the endor-side isolation/globalThis/
//! endowments/module-map unit corpus below.
