//! The `match`-dispatch interpreter (design § Interpreter and
//! dispatch). It executes the exact bytecode the C-XS compiler emits
//! (captured by the oracle), so during stages 1 through 4 the byte
//! stream is identical and any divergence has one suspect: the
//! interpreter.
//!
//! Stage 1 covered the pure-expression subset (arithmetic, logic,
//! bitwise, comparison, unary, branch, stack/result). Stage 2 adds the
//! program frame and its scope: `RESERVE`/`NEW_LOCAL`/`NEW_TEMPORARY`
//! scope slots, the `*_LOCAL` accessors, the environment/variable
//! opcodes (`EVAL_ENVIRONMENT`/`EVAL_REFERENCE`/`GET_VARIABLE`/
//! `SET_VARIABLE`), and backward-branch control flow (loops) over
//! compiler-emitted bytecode — the call/frame machinery's scope half.
//!
//! Semantics are ported case-by-case from `xs/sources/xsRun.c` at the
//! `c/moddable` pin: integer fast paths with checked-overflow promotion
//! to `f64`, XS's `-0` handling on multiply/modulo/minus, ToInt32 on
//! the bitwise ops, NaN-aware comparison, and the scope-slot addressing
//! `mxEnvironment - index`.
//!
//! **Allocation-faithful metering (stage 2b).** Computrons are bit-exact
//! for programs that allocate at run time, not only for pure
//! expressions. The meter accrues, in raw 16.16 units so they compose
//! through the carry into computrons:
//!  - **per dispatched opcode** `XS_CODE_METERING` (1<<16), as `mxBreak`;
//!  - **the program overhead** once at `BEGIN_*`: the invocation baseline
//!    ([`PROGRAM_INVOCATION_COMPUTRONS`] dispatches in the caller frame)
//!    plus the eval-environment setup aggregate
//!    ([`PROGRAM_ENV_SETUP_METERING`], measured against the pin);
//!  - **per slot allocation** `XS_SLOT_ALLOCATION_METERING` (1<<8) where
//!    `fxNewSlot` runs — a top-level `var` hoisted onto the global object
//!    at `EVAL_ENVIRONMENT`, or a sloppy global created at
//!    `SET_VARIABLE`;
//!  - **per property store** one built-in step
//!    `XS_BUILTIN_METERING` (1<<14, `mxMeterOne`) at `SET_VARIABLE`.
//! The upshot is the "16920 per var" the 2a differential probe measured
//! is now *reproduced* (536 allocation + 16384 store), and the stage-2
//! var/loop corpus graduates into the bit-exact bar. `GET_VARIABLE`
//! reads meter no built-in step, matching the oracle.
//!
//! No JIT, no code generation, no execution-count-dependent behavior
//! (requirement 4): a straight `match` LLVM lowers to a jump table.
