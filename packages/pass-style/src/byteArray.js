 *   a plain ordinary object whose `[[Prototype]]` is `Uint8Array.prototype`
 *   with **no own integer-indexed own properties**, regardless of `length`.
 *   The shim exposes data through the prototype-chain amplifier; there are
 *   never any own indexed slots on the wrapper itself.
 *
 * - **Native shape** (produced by a TC39-spec-following engine once the
 *   Immutable ArrayBuffer proposal ships): an integer-indexed exotic with
 *   exactly `length`-many own enumerable indexed data properties, each
 *   matching the underlying buffer byte at that offset.
 *
 * Any other own-key count (between 0 and `length`, exclusive, or above
 * `length`) is post-construction tampering and is rejected. Non-index own
 * properties are rejected in both shapes. Indexed own properties that are
 * present on a native-shape wrapper but whose value disagrees with the
 * underlying buffer byte are also rejected.
 *
 * The view must additionally span its whole backing buffer one-to-one
 * (`byteOffset === 0 && length === buffer.byteLength`): a sub-view is
 * rejected (the restrictive choice, issue #573), so the marshalled value
 * never conveys a hidden tail of the buffer beyond what the view reveals.
 *
 * Assumes the candidate has already passed the `isFrozen` gate that
 * `passStyleOf` applies before reaching any helper.
